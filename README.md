# Gaussian09D-Energy-Analysis-From-Log-Files-
It is a simple project to help computational chemists who are using *Gaussian09* as a software to solve some computational problems to generate an excel file with some significant values from the log files. 

For the first generation, it is mainly used to collect *SCF DONE* and *Gibbs Thermal Correction* from the log files and it is able to choose files as different value sources. But its outlook is not beautiful and it is only a python file not an application.
